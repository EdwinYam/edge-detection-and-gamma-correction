# edge-detection-and-gamma-correction
It's about image processing.

This project is able to be compiled using GNU GCC Compiler.

#Gamma correction

Gamma correction is a common operation in our digital cameras. Without it, pictures might be darker because the nonlinear response caused by electronic sensors or displays.
